This is a tool used to estimate the chance of wining a game of poker in RDR2.

Future plans
1. Add another script to calculate bets and how much one should bet based on the risk they want.
2. Add a script to have monitor opponents and build a profile against them to hopefully help predict what they will do.
3. Work on optimizing this script as much as possible to be as fast as possible.
